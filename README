This is a killer build of nginx including most of the good modules out there

It has been patched a little to support luajit-beta-6 and I have made a batteries included
luajit installer that is included with this package.

All you need to do is first install Cmake:
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.3-Darwin-universal.tar.gz
(Make sure to also install the bin scripts when it asks you at the end of the installer)

Now to build super-nginx all you need to do is run this from the top level of this checkout:

./build.sh

Or if you also want it to build luajit-beta6 for you:

./build --with-luajit

./build --help will also show usage

If you don't already have LuaJit and just want the full meal deal 
make sure to include the --with-luajit flag

You will end up with a 'super-nginx' directory at the top level of this git repo
that is super badass.

Start it up by doing this:

$ cd super-nginx
$ ./sbin/nginx

Then open your browser to:

http://localhost:3000/

The nginx.conf that is included has a few examples already setup, try these url's out and 
have a peek at the nginx.conf to see how they work:

# hello world
location / 

# another hello world using nginx variables mixed with lua
location /concat

# try access /nginx_var?a=urmom
location /nginx_var

# transparent non-blocking I/O in Lua via subrequests
location /lua

# GET /recur?num=5 this is pretty cool example of recursion in the nginx.conf file
location /recur

Thanks mostly to the work of @agentzh and @chaoslawful for their killer nginx modules
And many thanks to the other nginx module authors that wrote modules I've included in this build

This pretty much makes nginx itself a killer app server that you could write async applications
with in lua that run inside nginx in coroutines never blocking the nginx event loop

this is super powerfull stuff and definitely deserves some blog posts which I will have forthcoming at my blog: http://brainspl.at
